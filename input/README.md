This is the directory that you use for raw data obtained from elsewhere. This data should never be manually edited or changed. Any constructed data drawn from this data should be placed in the output directory instead. 

For this project, we will use data extracted from the 2012-2016 [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org/). This data was extracted using the [GSS Data Explorer](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/).
