This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Here is an embedded code chunk for stargazer output in pdf form:

```{r texreg_example, results="asis", echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

Here is an embedded code chunk for a nice figure with captions: 

```{r figure_example, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A Lovely Caption Goes Here"}
boxplot(indegree~nsports, data=addhealth, las=1, 
        col="skyblue", xlab="Number of sports played",
        ylab="Number of friend nominations")
```
